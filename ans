To accomplish the tasks you've outlined, you can follow these steps. First, create a `zoo.py` file with the `hours()` function defined as described:

1. Create a `zoo.py` file with the following content:

```python
# zoo.py

def hours():
    print('Open 9-5 daily')
```

Now, let's proceed with the tasks:

2. In the interactive interpreter, import the `zoo` module as `menagerie` and call its `hours()` function:

```python
import zoo as menagerie
menagerie.hours()
```

3. Using the interpreter, explicitly import and call the `hours()` function from `zoo`:

```python
from zoo import hours
hours()
```

4. Import the `hours()` function as `info` and call it:

```python
from zoo import hours as info
info()
```

5. Create a plain dictionary with the key-value pairs 'a': 1, 'b': 2, and 'c': 3, and print it out:

```python
plain_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
print(plain_dict)
```

6. Make an `OrderedDict` called `fancy` from the same pairs listed in task 5 and print it. The `OrderedDict` will maintain the order of insertion:

```python
from collections import OrderedDict

fancy = OrderedDict([('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)])
print(fancy)
```

7. Make a default dictionary called `dict_of_lists` and pass it the argument `list`. Make the list `dict_of_lists['a']` and append the value 'something for a' to it in one assignment. Print `dict_of_lists['a']`:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

dict_of_lists = defaultdict(list)
dict_of_lists['a'].append('something for a')
print(dict_of_lists['a'])
```

Now, you've completed all the tasks.
